# SpinMaster
# Code to analyze dynamics of spindles
# See user_manual.m for usage
# See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630121 
#
# This code includes :
# - software to load and process microscopy images
# - a GUI to locate objects on an image
# - these objects can be areas (regions) or items (spindes)
# - saving/loading and editing of such objects
# - creating time sequence of individual objects (trajectories)
# - statistical analysis of trajectories
